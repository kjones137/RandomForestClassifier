<h1>CS 601 Project: Random Forest Classifier from Scratch</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Choosing a Dataset</h2>
<p>Before choosing a dataset to construct a random forest classifier, I reviewed the requirements for the dataset:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Must contain at least 5000 samples</li>
  <li>Must have at least 10 features</li></li>
</ul>
<p>With these requirements in mind I browsed kaggle for a classification dataset that piqued my interest and came across a dataset 
  that contains features of factors affecting liver health and a label that is the histologic stage of cirrhosis. This dataset had already been
cleaned and had had the addition of artificial data in order to increase the number of samples. In total, the dataset contains 25,000 samples
and 18 features which are used to predict the label. The dataset can be found at this link: <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadarshvelu/liver-cirrhosis-stage-classification'>Cirrhosis Dataset</a></p>
